# Block abusive Usernames
List of forbidden names to prevent concussion or fraud on directories and subdomains

# Why is this needed?
For example, you don't want someone to sign-up with the username titled `login` or `administrator`. And depending on your app or service, they could generate something like:

example.com/login
login.example.com
login@example.com

And use this to send out abusive emails and phishing links impersonating you or your service.

## Assumptions

* You have the hability to transform this list into Array, Json or CSV format for use in your prefered language or database.
